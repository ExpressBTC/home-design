<p><strong>Architectural Design Of Taj Mahal</strong>, It took around 22000 workers to build this monument. Probably the greatest European architectural influence on the Taj Mahal occurred in the mid 19th century. The board working under imperial supervision and direction consisted of several major architects of the time including Abd ul-Karim Makramat Khat Mamur Khan and principal designer Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The architectural design uses the interlocking arabesque concept in which each element stands on its own and perfectly integrates with the main structure.</p>
