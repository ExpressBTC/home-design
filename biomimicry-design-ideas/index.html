<p>As demonstrated in the use of biomimicry in the design of architecture transportation technology and consumer products biomimicry innovation inspired by nature is a highly effective problem-solving approach. In this stunning example of biomimicry the Delfino sonic boat merges inspirations from both dolphins Japanese trains to create a bullet-fast yet super-efficient watercraft. This is the basic idea that underlies biophilic design.
