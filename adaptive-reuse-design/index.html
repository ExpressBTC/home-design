Adaptive reuse can also preserve or partially preserve buildings of historical significance in a practical way that sees them used by the community. Blending historic building fabric with contemporary functions helps us craft unique places that catalyse urban renewal bridging past and future. The term Adaptive Reuse implies a change in use and occupancy or the rehabilitation of a previously unoccupied site space or building before reuse and occupancy.</p>

<p>As architects designers and the real estate industry get wise to embodied carbon and the benefits of adaptive reuse projects that transform existing buildings are taking off. Adaptive Reuse Refurbishment Preserving links to our past through the adaptation of old structures pays social economic and environmental dividends. For example converting an old church into a restaurant an old train station into an office space or an old windmill into a home. Adaptive reuse is the reuse of architecture for a new purpose. Its repurposing an existing space that has outlived the original purpose into new and innovative uses while at the same time retaining historic features.</p>

<p>Adaptive reuse of heritage buildings refers to repurposing or reusing an existing structure for a completely different purpose than what it was intended for. This is why many of us in the design and construction industry are increasingly focused on adaptive reuse a rehabilitation technique that maintains the character and structure of a building. In architecture adaptive reuse also called building reuse refers to the repurposing of an existing structure for new use.
