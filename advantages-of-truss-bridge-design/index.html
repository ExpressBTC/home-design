<p><strong>Advantages Of Truss Bridge Design</strong>, Warren truss bridges require lesser building material than most other bridge designs. Compared to other bridge designs truss bridge designs often require fewer materials to complete the structure. Another advantage of using trusses as the foundation of bridge design is that engineers can place the deck on top of the structure instead of incorporating the roadway within it. That allows it to be useful for high population traffic areas railroad crossings and other spans that are necessary.</p>
