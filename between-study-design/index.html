<p>The most common design is called a parallel study. In the present chapter we will define and compare various study designs and their usefulness for investigating relationships between an outcome and an exposure or study factor. A between subjects study design is sometimes referred to as a between groups design. Design In many ways the design of a study is more important than the analysis. Research design focuses on what type of study is planned and what kind of results are expected from the research.</p>
