<p>The Active Buildings Toolkit has been developed by Design Manager Joanna Clarke to share the principles and learnings from the Active Buildings with the aim of encouraging others to adopt or improve on them and to support wider uptake of low carbon designs. As the name implies Active House is about actively taking the initiative to do whatever is possible to deliver desirable outcomes for building occupants. Active Design in Buildings investigates how architecture influences our behavior. An active building sometimes referred to as an energy positive building is one that generates and stores its own electricity.

Active Design Active design on the other hand is a structure or system that either uses or is able to produce electricity itself which is something that describes the overwhelming majority of buildings that exist.
