<p>There are many famous examples of Cohort studies including the Framingham heart study 2 the UK study of doctors who smoke 3 and Professor Neville Butlers studies on British children born in 1958. The cohort design is a prospective or less commonly retrospective observational design in which the groups cohorts are determined by the level of the explanatory variable. A prospective cohort study design is ranked higher in the hierarchy of evidence than a retrospective design because the outcome predictor and confounding variables can be better measured and controlled. Retrospective cohort study is a type of study whereby investigators design the study recruit subjects and collect background information of the subject after the outcome of interest has been developed while the prospective cohort study is an investigation carried out before the outcomes of interest have been developed.
