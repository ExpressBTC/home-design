<p><strong>Architectural Design Methodology</strong>, Behavior structure and geometry. Conventional procedures of design such as drawing can be regarded as design methods but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together. Design methodology refers to the development of systematic processes or methods applied in the design activities of a particular field of study or practice like architecture urban design or industrial design. In this regard a researcher is required to have some theoretical knowledge regarding contents of the research study undertaken.</p>

WRITING A RESEARCH PROPOSAL. A design methodology is an overarching approach to design that may include a set of philosophies principles processes and techniquesIn some cases they are associated with a type of design such as architecture or graphic designIt is also possible for a methodology to be generic enough to apply to all design.
