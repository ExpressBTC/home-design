<p>In their recent publication with the emphasis of the feature of by design adaptations only rather than ad hoc adaptations the PhRMA Working Group on Adaptive Design refers to an adaptive design as a clinical trial design that uses accumulating data to decide on how to modify aspects of the study as it continues without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. In adaptive design its normal to develop six designs for the six most common screen widths. Adaptive designs ADs provide an alternative.

<p>Adaptive design is a broad approach to web design that focuses on suitability for a variety of interfaces rather than restricting itself to the format intended for a desktop display. This is especially significant in 2018 when smartphone search volumes have overtaken desktop search volumes in 10 countries even with tablet searches counted in the desktop category. Adaptive design is a broad approach to web design that focuses on suitability for a variety of interfaces rather than restricting itself to the format intended for a desktop display. Instead of one flexible design adaptive design detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics.
